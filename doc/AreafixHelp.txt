            Description of CrashMail's built-in AreaFix
            ===========================================

What is AreaFix?
----------------
AreaFix is a feature present at most FidoNet nodes, either built-in in
the tosser or as a stand-alone program. AreaFix allows you to connect
and disconnect to echomail areas, change your password and change some
other things in your configuration without asking your feed/boss to do
it for you.

How do I talk to AreaFix?
-------------------------
You communicate with AreaFix using netmail messages. The message header
of a message to AreaFix should look like this:

From: Johan Billing
  To: AreaFix
Subj: <password> [<switches>]

<AreaFix commands>
...
---

<Password> is your private AreaFix password that you need to make sure
that nobody else alters your configuration. Your AreaFix password is
assigned to you by your boss/feed, so you may have to ask him about a 
password.

[<switches>] are extra commands that you can send to AreaFix. Currently
there is only one switch:

 -l or -q         Send list of all areas

This switch is only here to be compatible with other AreaFix programs.
It is recommended that you use the %-commands described later instead.

"---" marks the end of an AreaFix message.

NOTE: The name doesn't necessarily have to be AreaFix, your boss may have
configured CrashMail to use other names instead.

What commands can I put in the text?
------------------------------------

Change connected areas:

[+]areaname[,R=<max>]   Connect to an area. The '+' is optional. If
                        the R option is specified after the area,
                        the specified number of old messages in the area
                        will be rescanned and sent to you.

-areaname               Disconnect from an area

=areaname[,R=<max>]     Update. You can use this to rescan an area which you
                        already are connected to.

Special commands

%HELP                   Send this text

%LIST                   Send list of all areas
%QUERY                  Send list of all linked areas
%UNLINKED               Send list of all unlinked areas

%PAUSE                  Do not send any echomail until a %RESUME is sent
%RESUME                 Send echomail again. These commands can be useful
                        if you are away for a few weeks and don't want to 
                        get any echomail.

%PWD <pw>               Changes your AreaFix password to the new password
                        specified after the command.

%COMPRESS <name>        Changes the packer used to compress your mail to
                        the packer specified after the command. Send
                        "%COMPRESS ?" to get a list of packers.

%RESCAN                 All areas that are added or updated after this
                        line will be rescanned, that is all old messages
                        in those areas will be sent to you. This can be
                        very dangerous since you don't know how many
                        messages you will get so in most cases, it is
                        better to use the R option when adding/updating
                        areas instead.

Examples:
=========

R20_TRASHCAN            Connect to R20_TRASHCAN

%LIST                   Send list of areas

R20_AMIGA,R=50          Connect to R20_AMIGA and get the last 50 messages
                        in the area.

%PWD xyzzy              Change your AreaFix password to "xyzzy".

%COMPRESS ZIP           Change your compression method to ZIP.

%PAUSE                  Turn off echomail for a while

%RESUME                 Turn on echomail again

=R20_AMIGA,R=100        Get the last 100 messages in R20_AMIGA (if you are
                        already connected to the area)

A few words on rescan
=====================
Messages that are rescanned might not look exactly like they originally did
because of the way they are stored locally. When messages are rescanned from
a JAM messagebase, all control lines ("kludges") will be at the beginning of
the message regardless of where they originally were. You can easily tell if 
a message has been rescanned, just look for the RESCANNED control line.
